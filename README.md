# bricknave.net
The source code of my LEGO fansite, [bricknave.net](http://www.bricknave.net), which was created from scratch with HTML, CSS, PHP, and JavaScript from 2011-2016. PHP was used to create the personality quizzes and a dynamic gallery system that automatically loaded images. JavaScript was used for a few gallery-related functions. The website itself has a flat architecture, and one of the reasons it remains untouched is
because changing it would break some hyperlinks that are used in a "badge" system that refers back to the personality quizzes.
