<br />
It is good to use if you need a clean place to store bricks, and makes a great collector's item.<br />

<b>-Interesting bricks-</b><br />
<br />

<br />
In my opinion, these are the most interesting bricks found in the set. Some of the decals on the bricks are stickers.<br />
<br />
<b>-The Camp-</b><br />
<br />

<br />
There isn't much about it that makes it special, except for the printed-decal sarcophagus.<br />
<br />
<b>-The Jeep-</b><br />
<br />

<br />
A very good model, considering that it is one of the very few set models that have a black jeep cabin brick.<br />
The side-mounted rifle turret is also a nice touch, but it makes the jeep look more like a WW1 combat<br /> 
vehicle than an exploration vehicle (good if you're a military builder).<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>-The Bi-plane-</b><br />
<br />

<br />
In my opinion, the best model in the set. It has a wide variety of bricks in tan and white that aren't usually in those colors.<br />
The panels with the "shark mouth" stickers on them can flip out to expose the bi-plane's mighty engine!<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>-Conclusion-</b><br />
<br />
Overall rating on a 1-to-10 scale: 8<br />
<br />
Overall rating on a 1-to-5 scale: 4.5<br />
<br />
This set is definitely a good one, but it isn't really an absolute must-have, unless you need more vintage vehicles for your LEGO collection.<br />
The models are great, except for the small campsite, which begs for something else to be added to it.<br />
The set is also good in terms of MOC-ability, as it offers vehicle bricks that are in rare colors.<br />
