This is one of my favorite Travellers Tales games.<br />
LEGO Batman is based on Batman: The Animated series,<br />
and has it's own unique story.<br />
From a Builder's perspective, my favorite feature is the character creator,<br />
which allows you to create custom heroes and villains.<br />
Some of the pieces in the character creator can be used to create<br />
some of the characters from the comics, such as The Spoiler,<br />
which might be interesting to DC fans.<br />
Another thing DC fans might be interested in are the<br />
unlock-able "facts" in the game's hub, which feature details<br />
about the character of the Batman comics.<br />
<br />
LEGO Batman was the first Travellers Tales PC LEGO game to exceed<br />
the limit of 18 story levels (LEGO Batman has 30.)<br />
One feature that sets LEGO batman apart from other games is the<br />
abundance of story levels played from the antagonist's viewpoint.<br />
However, LEGO Batman doesn't seem to have as many characters as<br />
other Travellers Tales games.<br />
<br />
However, the main issue I have with the PC version of this game is a glitch<br />
which prevents me from unlocking a certain character.  I do not think this<br />
glitch is present in the console versions of this game.<br />
