<td><img src="pics/reviews/LEGO_POTC_Game_Cover.jpg" width="240" height="180"/><div class="review_desc">LEGO Pirates of the Caribbean the video game offers as much adventure and problem solving as the LEGO Indiana Jones titles!
There have been a lot of improvements to the gameplay mechanics, and some of the gameplay features have been incorporated from previous LEGO Video game titles.
Like the LEGO Indiana Jones titles, players can pick up objects to solve puzzles, and there is a greater balance between brawling and exploring.
The one thing previous titles don't have is the magical compass item, which leads Jack Sparrow to useful objects (Indiana Jones would be jealous).
When all 8 useful objects are found in a level, the player is given a gold brick.  So not only will you search for Ship-in-a-Bottles (minikits) and red pirate hats (red bricks), but you'll also have to follow where your compass leads you.</div></td>
