<b>-The Minifigures-</b><br />
<br />
<img src="pics/reviews/time_train_minifigs.jpg"></img>
<br />
The passengers on the Twisted Time Train: Two bad-looking chums who seem to be wearing some kind of military uniform, a wizard skeleton, and a ghost.<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>-The Locomotive-</b><br />
<br />
Time Twister 1 will guide you through the building of the locomotive!<br />
<br />

<br />
And walla, the locomotive!<br />
It is a blend of futuristic elements with a steam train design.<br />
When it is pushed, the funnel moves up and down (as you'll see later.)<br />
The cabin has a radar screen, which is interesting, because I don't think radar works when the vehicle is traveling at light speed.<br />
Or maybe it isn't traveling at light speed, maybe it goes through worm-holes ...<br />
Also, at the sides are holders for a sword and a knife.<br />
I'm assuming the leader of the Time Twisters wields the sword during missions, whoever the leader is.<br />
<br />
<b>-The Skeleton Car-</b><br />
<br />
Now for the next section, which I call the skeleton car.

<br />
The build is fairly complex and challenging.<br />
Two parts of the car turn when the wheels move. Both functions use rubber bands.<br />
The skeleton on top appears to be spamming into the megaphone while spinning.<br />
The car also has somewhat of an interior, which is a balcony with a barrel that contains a knife and dynamite.<br />
<br />
<b>-The Ghost car-</b><br />
<br />
The final car, which I call the ghost car. It appears to be a haunted castle on wheels.<br />
Time Twister 2 and his ghostly accomplice will guide you through most of the building process!<br />
<br />

<br />
<img src="pics/reviews/time_ghost_4.jpg"></img>
<br />
As the car moves, the ghost passenger spins around.<br />
I wonder why the ghost has a magic wand?  It must be the spirit of a wizard.<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>-The Functions-</b><br />

The Functions of the locomotive and the cars moving in unison.
<br />
<br />
<b>-Conclusion-</b><br />
<br />
<img src="pics/reviews/time_train_funny.jpg"></img>
<i>An interesting part of the instructions.</i><br />
<br />
<br />
The upsides of the set are the individual functions for the cars and the variety of pieces!<br />
Each of the functions work great when their respective cars are pulled individually! <br />
The combination of castle elements with western and town elements make this set somewhat of a three-in-one set.<br />
<br />
The downsides are the hovering pair of wheels and lack of interior for the non-locomotive cars.<br />
Like I've stated before, one pair of wheels is always lifted into the air when the whole train is pulled altogether.<br />
The interior of the locomotive is as good as it gets, but the walls on the other cars are really used to cover up the Technic axles, which is understandable.<br />
Although, I still think they could've expanded the shelter of the skeleton car, maybe adding walls and a removable roof to the barrel-area.<br />
There must be more shelter on the cars to protect time-traveling passengers from cosmic time travel rain.<br />
<br />
Downsides aside, this set is great for getting ideas for Technic-related functions and for parts!<br />
