LEGO Batman 2: DC Super Heroes introduced two features to LEGO Traveler's Tales games:<br />
voice acting (instead of phantomimes) and Checkpoints (so now you don't have to worry about starting over from the beginning if you leave mid-way.)<br />
<br />
You don't have to buy the first LEGO Batman game in order to understand the story of the sequel. Both stories are stand-alone.<br />
Infact, LEGO Batman 2 feels more like a reboot than a sequel, because Gotham City in this game doesn't really resemble the Gotham City in the first game.<br />
Not only that, but the Bat Cave is also radically different.<br />
<br />
Unlike the first few LEGO TT games, campaign levels are unlocked in an open world, rather than in a small indoor environment.<br />
<br />
Campaign gameplay mostly revolves around playing as Batman (of course), Robin and Superman.<br />
The other members of the Justice League don't show up until later in the campaign.<br />
<br />
Aside from playing through the main campaign and replaying it in free play mode, there are oodles of things to find and unlock in the open world.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, this game (the PC version) is not without glitches.<br />
Sometimes, the keys will freeze and I would have to pull up the task manager to unfreeze them.<br /> 
Another glitch is a spontaneous non-stop cycle through the collection of characters in Free Play mode.<br />
One time, there was a serious glitch in which the screen froze at a cutscene, so I had to shut the computer down and redo the level.<br />  
Fortunately, I never encountered that last glitch again.<br />
<br />
Final notes:<br />
*If you like collecting things and boss battles, I recommend this as a LEGO video game.<br />
*If you are a hardcore Batman fan and love Batman: The Animated Series, I think you'll enjoy the first LEGO Batman game more.<br />
The first LEGO Batman resembled BTAS more, and had more of that Batman feel to it.<br />
*If you aren't a hardcore Batman fan, but Batman is your favorite superhero and you are passionate about the rest of the DC Universe,<br />
I think you'll enjoy playing this with your family.<br />
