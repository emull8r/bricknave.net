LEGOLAND is LEGO's entry to the theme park genre of video games,<br />
inspired by the real life LEGOLAND theme parks.<br />
It demonstrates monetary concepts such as workers' wages and budgets,<br />
but with the setting being a vibrant LEGO amusement park.<br />
Here are several notable features I'd like to mention:<br />
<br />
<u>*It encourages critical thinking.</u><br />
The park is routinely visited by guests, whom the player must satisfy<br />
by building and managing attractions.<br />
If guests aren't satisfied with things, they aren't going to spend as much money,<br />
but they'll spend more money if they are satisfied.<br />
<br />
<u>*The player must work within limits.</u><br />
In the normal levels, the player is given a budget,<br />
and must hire workers most of the time to do park maintenance.<br />
However, hiring workers costs money, and so does the tasks the workers do.<br />
So, the player must assess whether or not<br />
they can afford things and make critical choices.<br />
<br />
<u>*The player must take criticism.</u><br />
In the normal levels, an Inspector visits the park,<br />
and the player must fill all the necessary requirements asked by the inspector, 
or else their park will be closed.<br />
<br />
<u>*There is a Free Play mode.</u><br /> 
In the free play mode, the player can create the LEGOLAND of<br />
their dreams without limits.<br />
<br />
<b>Additional Information:</b><br />
