<b>LEGO Chima Online review:</b><br />
<br />
<img src="pics/reviews/Chima_Online/Adventuring.jpg" >
<br />
<br />
The LEGO Group's most recent multiplayer online game, <a href="http://chimaonline.com" target="_blank">Chima Online</a>,<br />
combines the obstacle course fun of the LEGO Travelers Tales games with a social gameplay experience.<br />
I find it vaguely similar to yet vastly different from LEGO Universe.<br />
<br />
<b>The payment model:</b><br />
<br />
Chima Online uses the Freemium model.<br />
<i>(Freemium is slang for "most of the content is free, but extra stuff costs money")</i><br />
It has a monthly membership and a store to directly buy Gold Bricks (an in-game currency).<br />
I wouldn't call it "Pay2Win," because there is no competition between paying and non-paying players.<br />
<br />
<b>The Online aspect:</b><br />
<br />
Chatting and Friends lists exist.  You can visit the Outpost (player-owned home) of a friend,<br />
and link up with them in the larger gameworld by clicking on them in the Map.<br />
<br />
<img src="pics/reviews/Chima_Online/Map_2.jpg" ><br />
<br />
So far, there can only be 4 players in one zone at a time, so each zone is really a large "dungeon."<br />
When it comes to communication, so far there is only Quick Chatting; but actual keyword chatting will come later.<br />
You can use the in-game player market to buy or sell items (using the in-game currency).<br />
<br />
Gameplay and LEGO aspects:</b><br />
<br />
<b>Character creation:</b><br />
<br />
There are 4 tribes to choose from, all of which are on the good-guy side:<br />
Lions, Eagles, Gorillas and (to my surprise) Bears.  Heads, torsos and legs can use three different colors.<br />
The way you play in terms of fighting enemies is customizable, so there are no "Classes" to worry about.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, your character is very restricted when it comes to names (so far).<br />
You can only use names like "Solo AvianTracker" or "Epic WillfulSpark."<br />
<br />
<b>Travel:</b><br />
<br />
Travel through the open gameworld is much more like a LEGO Travelers Tales game than what you would<br />
find in a typical MMO (Massively Multiplayer Online game), which I find refreshing.<br />
<br />
Players can't jump, but there are obstacle courses featuring things like spinning blades and pressure pads.<br />
<br />
<img src="pics/reviews/Chima_Online/Adventuring_2.jpg" ><br />
<br />
There is a good balance between planning your way through obstacle courses and smashing enemy hordes.<br />
<br />
<img src="pics/reviews/Chima_Online/Map.jpg" ><br />
<br />
The pathways in zones are very non-linear.<br />
Scattered throughout the gameworld are Checkpoints (places to rebuild after getting smashed) and<br />
Portals (which you can teleport to directly from your outpost).<br />
<br />
<b>Quests / Missions:</b><br />
<br />
Based on the first 8 levels I've played through so far, there is one central series of quests and side quests that pop up.<br />
In most MMOs, players must find quest-giving Non-Player Characters; in Chima Online, quests automatically appear on the screen.<br />
<br />
<img src="pics/reviews/Chima_Online/Quest_2.jpg" width="30%" height="30%">  <img src="pics/reviews/Chima_Online/Quest.png" width="30%" height="30%"><br />
<br />
Also, there is actual voice dialog for every NPC involved in a quest (which I'm sure kids will find appealing).<br />
The quest experience is somewhat linear, but then again most quest experiences are linear.<br />
<br />
<b>Currencies:</b><br />
<br />
There are two currencies: The plentiful Studs and the special Gold Bricks.<br />
If you've played a LEGO Travelers Tales game, you'll know Studs can be collected by smashing scenery and baddies.<br />
Gold Bricks are collected from Quests, visiting the Outposts of friends, and by being lucky enough to find one.<br />
Both currencies are used to buy and upgrade buildings, in addition to buying items off the market.<br />
<br />
<b>Combat:</b><br />
<br />
Combat is straight-forward: Whack a baddy until they break apart.<br />
<br />
<img src="pics/reviews/Chima_Online/Combat.jpg" ><br />
<br />
Weapons with different effects and craftable deployables take the roll of "Classes,"<br />
which I find refreshing because there is no single playstyle to be confined to.<br />
Also, you can carry two different weapons at the same time, each controlled by separate mouse buttons.<br />
<br />
<img src="pics/reviews/Chima_Online/Inventory.jpg" ><br />
<br />
My primary weapon is ranged, and I use a stronger melee weapon when baddies get too close.<br />
However, you could have any arrangement of weapons.<br />
In fact, you are allowed to have a healing gun in each hand, which I think is great!<br />
<br />
Another aspect of combat I find interesting is the use of Chi power-ups, which make you invincible<br />
for a short time. You will often find these useful when you find yourself outnumbered by enemies, so things<br />
aren't <i>too</i> hard. Chi power-ups can be found in the gameworld and earned from quests.<br />
<br />
<b>Crafting and Items:</b><br />
<br />
Chima Online excels in this area where the last multiplayer online game created by<br />
The LEGO Group failed; LEGO Universe didn't even have crafting.<br />
<br />
<img src="pics/reviews/Chima_Online/Crafting.jpg" ><br />
<br />
Not only can you craft your own weapons and clothes, you can also color them based on which bricks you're using.<br />
<br />
<img src="pics/reviews/Chima_Online/Crafting_2.jpg" ><br />
<br />
In order to craft an item, one must obtain its Building Instructions, in addition to collecting some bricks.<br />
<br />
The two biggest flaws with crafting:
*You have a very limited variety of 1x2 brick colors in lower levels.<br />
*Instructions disappear after you craft its respective item (you'd have to obtain them again).<br />
<br />
However, there are buildings you can place in your Outpost that give you bricks (more on that coming up next).<br />
<br />
Another issue I think needs to be addressed is the lack of an infinite venue to buy health-restoration consumables.<br />
In the first several levels, I had to whack enemies and props to gather them, and I never had more than 5 at a time.<br />
Perhaps there are or will be a consumable-producing building for Outposts.<br />
<br />
<b>Building and Outposts:</b><br />
<br />
Chima Online does not have true brick-by-brick building like LEGO Universe.<br />
Bricks, as mentioned earlier, are used for crafting items.<br />
<br />
However, you CAN customize your Outpost with buildings that serve different functions.<br />
<br />
<img src="pics/reviews/Chima_Online/Outpost_1.jpg" ><br />
<br />
Houses will produce Studs, which can be used for upgrading or making other buildings, in addition to buying items.<br />
Blacksmiths and Armorers are used for crafting items, as mentioned in the last section.<br />
<br />
<img src="pics/reviews/Chima_Online/Outpost_3.jpg" ><br />
<br />
There are buildings which give you bricks for crafting, as mentioned before.<br />
Some buildings will produce Powers (such as deployable turrets and groups of troops) for you to use in the gameworld.<br />
<br />
<img src="pics/reviews/Chima_Online/Store.jpg" ><br />
<br />
One special building, unlocked at level 7, allows you to buy or sell items from players (using Studs as the currency).<br />
A seller may place an item into their store and wait for someone to buy it while the seller goes on adventures,<br />
instead of having to seek out potential buyers in the gameworld.<br />
<br />
<img src="pics/reviews/Chima_Online/Outpost_4.jpg" ><br />
<br />
More space for Outposts can be acquired by spending Gold Bricks, or regular Studs if you're a Premium member.<br />
<br />
Outposts are acquired very early in the game (earlier than when you get your first Property in LEGO Universe),<br />
and it essentially serves as your central hub, which I think is fantastic!<br />
<br />
By visiting the Outposts of friends, one can collect Studs which go toward the collection of a Gold Brick.<br />
<br />
<b>Overview:</b><br />
<br />
Chima Online is a refreshing gameplay experience for me, considering I played four different MMOs in the past.<br />
<br />
<b>Pros:</b><br />
*Outposts: I love the idea of player-owned homes being the player's hub, rather than a town in the gameworld.<br />
*Crafting: Being able to re-color an item <i>while</i> crafting it is the bomb.<br />
*Obstacle Courses: Bored of whacking endless waves of enemies? These keep things fresh. They often make you have to think for a moment.<br />
*Voice Dialog: Makes questing a bit more fun.<br />
<br />
<b>Cons:</b><br />
*Instructions disappear after the respective item has been crafted.<br />
I do not know whether this is a bug or not, but I can't imagine it would be considering how polished everything is.<br />
*No infinite venue of buyable health consumables. Because of the scarcity of health refills, adventuring can be rough at times.<br />
Fortunately, Chi power-ups make a difference.<br />
*4-person per zone limit sometimes makes linking up with friends impossible.<br />
<br />
If you're a parent, I'd like to let you know Chima Online is totally child safe.<br />
Trust me, safety is one of The LEGO Group's first concerns when it comes to online experiences.<br />

If you're a gamer who is tired of endless enemy-grinding, I think you will find the Outposts and obstacle courses to be refreshing.
