LEGO Racers and its sequel LEGO Racers 2 are 
LEGO's entries to the racing genre of video games.<br />
What makes these games unique is the opportunity<br />
to build cars using LEGO bricks.<br />
The setting is a variety of worlds based on<br />
different themes of sets produced by LEGO.<br />
<br />
In this review, I'll compare LEGO Racers 2 with LEGO Racers 1:<br />
<br />
<u>*Building:</u><br />
The building feature in LEGO Racers 2 requires numpads to rotate bricks.<br />
LEGO Racers 1 does not, so it is best for laptops that don't have Numpads.<br />
LEGO Racers 1 lets you mix and match pieces from a variety of themes,<br />
rather than restricting car building to one specific theme like in LEGO Racers 2.<br />
LEGO Racers 2 offers many more car chassis to build on than LEGO Racers 1.<br />
LEGO Racers 1 has many more minifigure parts to use when<br />
customizing a driver than LEGO Racers 2.<br />
LEGO Racers 2 challenges players to build a new car for each theme.<br />
LEGO Racers 1 gives players more freedom.<br />
<br />
<u>*Gameplay:</u><br />
<br />
The racing in LEGO Racers 2 is done with Checkpoints set on a larger world.<br />
In LEGO Racers, each track is it's own world and there are no checkpoints.<br />
Racing is more challenging in LEGO Racers 2 than LEGO Racers 1,<br />
which can lead to repeated restarting of races which may be frustrating to young players.<br />
<br />
You can explore worlds in LEGO Racers 2, in which the main<br />
goals are finding hidden collectibles and bonus games.<br />
Although most of the bonus games are pretty much the same thing,<br />
they offer Upgrades for your car, which in turn makes gameplay easier.<br />
<br />
Another thing to mention about LEGO Racers 1 is that you don't have<br />
to beat a Boss in order to challenge the next one.<br />
However, you will not gain access to the customization options that boss offers.<br />
This means if a boss is too challenging for a player,<br />
they could still continue the game if they come in second or third place.<br />
<br />
<u>*Boiling it down:</u><br />
I recommend LEGO Racers 1 for children younger than 9,<br />
because the racing experience is less frustraing than LEGO Racers 2.<br />
I also recommend LEGO Racers 1 for people who are<br />
more interested in building than racing, and love the classic LEGO themes.<br />
I recommend LEGO Racers 2 to people who are more interested in racing<br />
than building, because of the advanced racing experience<br />
and wide selection of pre-built cars.<br />
<br />
