It was only a matter of time before LEGO made construction sets based on Tolkien's Middle-Earth, and a Travelers Tales game to compliment them.<br />
<br />
In past LEGO games, characters communicated using grumbles and phantomimes,<br />
but the Minifigure inhabitants of Middle-Earth use the voice dialogue from the movies.<br />
<br />
The whole world of Middle-Earth is open for exploration (albiet on a smaller scale for convenience, but it isn't bitesized).<br />
To play new levels, one must journey to their respective locations, rather than simply walking into a doorway like in LEGO Star Wars 1 & 2.<br />
<br />
Aside from the levels, there are oodles of side quests to do and things to find in Middle-Earth.<br />
The inhabitants of Middle-Earth will give you Mithril(used to forge special items one could use anywhere except in the main campaign),<br />
or unveil an unlockable Extra (cheats such as Invincibility) if you find for them a one-of-a-kind item or a Mithril-forged item, respectively.<br />
One thing I find odd about the side quests is that you keep the quest items afterwards. I know for sure this is not a glitch.<br />
It would've made more sense if you had to buy back the treasures from the quest-givers.<br />
<br />
However, the PC version of LEGO LOTR is not without glitches.<br />
It is common for the keys to freeze, so I'd have to Control+Alt+Delete+Task Manager to unfreeze them.<br />
There are two small invisible walls in the bonus level that prevent me from completing two minor objectives.<br />
When completing a side quest as Legolas, there is this common animation glitch of him giving his bow to the quest-giver instead of the quest item.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you are a Tolkien fan, I think you'll enjoy playing this with your family.<br />
There is tongue-in-cheek humor, but it doesn't distabilize Tolkien's story.<br />  
I think you'll enjoy the unlockable characters who weren't in the movies, such as a merry fellow with a coat bright blue and boots yellow.<br />
<br />
If you're a gamer who wants to get a Travelers Tales LEGO game to play with your family,<br />
who also likes exploration and collectibles, I recommend either this or LEGO Batman 2.<br />
As I said before, there are oodles of things to do and collect throughout the open world.<br />
