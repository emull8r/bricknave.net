<br />
Rivendell is one of my favorite fictional locations.<br />
The Elven architecture, the trees, the waterfalls ... *Sigh* If only it were real.<br />
Let's see how well this set captures that essence!<br />
<br />
<b>-The Box-</b><br />
<br />
<img src="pics/reviews/Council_of_Elrond/Council_of_Elrond_box_front.jpg"></img>
<br />
Instead of a picture of the One Ring like in the previous wave, we have a picture of The Eye of Sauron in the top-right corner.<br />
<br />

<br />
<b>-The Contents-</b><br />
<br />
<img src="pics/reviews/Council_of_Elrond/Council_of_Elrond_contents.jpg"></img>
<br />
Instructions, a small sticker sheet, and two bags of bricks and smaller bags of bricks.<br />
Bag #1 gives us the round patio, bag #2 gives us the Elven building (or at least section of one).<br />
<br />

<br />
From left to right: Elrond, Arwen, Frodo Baggins, and Gimli.<br />
If you're unfamiliar with LOTR, these are all good-guys.<br />

<b>-The Pieces-</b><br />
<br />
The Extra pieces:</b><br />
<br />
<img src="pics/reviews/Council_of_Elrond/Council_of_Elrond_extra_pieces.jpg"></img>
<br />
Extra weapons and two extra rings! Woot!<br />
<br />
The most interesting pieces (in my opinion):</b><br />
<br />
<img src="pics/reviews/Council_of_Elrond/Council_of_Elrond_Most_Interesting.jpg"></img>
<br />
Elven Sword (x2), Gold 4x4 Round Plates (x2), Light Gray Microfigures (x2),<br />
Dark Orange Tree Branch with Leaves (x3), White 1x3x3 Half Arch (x4)<br />
<br />
<b>-The complete model(s)-</b><br />
<br />
<img src="pics/reviews/Council_of_Elrond/Council_of_Elrond_modules.jpg"></img>
<br />
We have two big modules and a detachable weapons rack.<br />
<br />
<b>-The Function-</b><br />
<br />

<br />
The function simulates the scene in which Gimli tries to destroy the One Ring, but is flung back by it's power!<br />
<br />

<br />
The inner workings of the function, for those of you who may be curious.<br />
<br />
<b>-Conclusion-</b><br />
<br />
Excellent pieces and design for this price range!<br />
The modules fit together perfectly, and I find the function to be cleverly made. It definitely captures the essence of Rivendell.<br />
<br />
My one gripe is that the chairs are somewhat useless, because the Minifigures can't sit into them.<br />
You can pretend Frodo and Gimli could sit into the chairs, but that's about it.<br />
Theoretically, Elrond should be able to sit into one of the chairs, but his hairpiece and cape make that non-feasible.<br />
<br />
What would've made this set better is if Aragorn (or better yet, Boromir) was included<br />instead of Frodo, so one of the three chairs could be properly used.<br />
<br />
On a scale of 1-to-5 I rate this a 4.<br />

<br />
Can you spot the printing mistake?<br />
<br />

<br />
I didn't know about a LEGO LOTR board game until I found this teaser for it in the instruction manual.<br />
I'm quite surprised I didn't learn about it from the internet.<br />
