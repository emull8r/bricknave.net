<b>LEGO Minifigures Online Review</b><br />
Built in a partnership between LEGO and Funcom, Minifigures Online is a MOBA-styled MMO featuring characters from the Collectible Minifigures line.<br />
Keep in mind that this review was written while the game was in Open Beta.<br />
<br />

<br />
<b>Characters</b><br />
Your perspective is from the top down. You control a team of three Minifigures, but only one at a time.<br />
They all share the same location, but each has a separate health bar.<br />
You do not create Minifigures. Instead, you play as ones based on their real-life counterparts sold in stores.<br />
<br />
<img src="pics/reviews/Minifigures_Online/Minifigures_Online_Pick_Character.png"></img>
<br />
Minifigures specialize in one of three roles: Attacking, Defending and Building.<br />
<br />
Minifigures are upgraded using Stars and Bricks.<br />
<br />
<img src="pics/reviews/Minifigures_Online/Upgrading.png"></img>
<br />
Stars are the most plentiful thing you can collect from smashing objects and fighting enemies.<br />
They can unlock upgrades ranging from extra health to special abilities.<br />
<br />

<br />
Bricks are used to fill in a unique mosaic.<br />
Each color gives you points towards Attacking (Red), Defending (Blue) and Building (Yellow).<br />
<br />
<b>Social</b><br />
You have a list of acquaintances, and can form teams.<br />
<br />

<br />
You do not type out your character's name. Instead, your character's name consists of three words you've selected.<br />
<br />

<br />
<b>Building</b><br />
There are two types of building: automatic building as done in LEGO Star Wars, and the mosaic thing I've showed you.<br />
What differentiates Builders from other Minifigures is the speed at which they can automatically assemble models.<br />
And, that's about it.<br />
<br />
<b>Combat</b><br />
Every Minifigure has a main attack (left click) and a secondary attack (right click), which is more powerful than the main attack but can be used less often.<br />
<br />

<br />
When a Minifigure loses all of their health, it takes 20 minutes for them to be rebuilt.<br />
Fortunately, you can use the rest of your available Minifigures.<br />
Unlike LEGO Chima Online, enemies are much more diverse.<br />
<br />
<b>Missions</b><br />
There are Missions, complete with Dialog. Like LEGO Chima Online, you accept the main series of missions automatically.<br />
Unlike LEGO Chima Online, there are no voice-overs for mission-giver dialog. Just this goofy sound, repeated over and over for every letter.<br />
<br />
<img src="pics/reviews/Minifigures_Online/Minifigures_Online_Dialog.png"></img>
<br />
Speaking of dialog: your Minifigures actually have dialog in some form.<br />
However, they do not actually speak with the NPCs. They mutter gibberish every now and then.<br />
<br />
<b>Worlds</b><br />
There are different zones, referred to as worlds.<br />
However, each world must be unlocked in a specific order: Pirate World, Castle World, Space World, and Mythological World.<br />
There are also zones within zones, AKA "dungeons" or "instances", scattered throughout the worlds.<br />
<br />
<b>Payment Model</b><br />
This is your usual free-to-play game with monthly subscription on the side.<br />
Like LEGO Chima Online, the currency you can buy with real money can also be collected in the game for free.<br />
This currency is called "Diamonds."<br />
<br />
<img src="pics/reviews/Minifigures_Online/Membership.png"></img>
<br />
It is possible to obtain a month of membership for free, but you of course must collect a lot of Diamonds in-game.<br />
<br />
<img src="pics/reviews/Minifigures_Online/Members_Only.png"></img>
<br />
Special chests and special "dungeons" are only accessible to paying Members.<br />
<br />
<b>Final Thoughts:</b><br />
If you're a child or a casual gamer, you might like this.<br />
If you're a serious LEGO fan, you might enjoy looking at the virtual LEGO environments.<br />
That is all.<br />
